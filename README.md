# Paiting Dots

This project is a simple app that draws random colored circles or dots using the Turtle graphics library.

## How it works

Using the Turtle Graphics module, this project generates randomly colored dots in a sequential manner, creating a visually appealing pattern.

## More About this project

This project was created to practice Python GUI development in a practical, real-world scenario by building an intermediate-level application. Inspired by a challenge from the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), the goal of this project is to deepen the understanding and application of GUI principles through an engaging and interactive dot-drawing app. By using the Turtle Graphics library, this project offers a hands-on approach to learning and mastering Python GUI techniques.
